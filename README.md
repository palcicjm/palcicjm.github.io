## Self-Reflection:
I thought I did alright on this assigment. My site is not incredible but gets all the information laid out neatly and in a way that is not painful to look at. I had trouble with GitHub Pages and I felt the instructions were not very clear. I ended up using a different set of instructions and just copying my local files into a new repository. I don't know if that is the correct way to do this, so I lost myself a point. However, both sites appear clearly on both links. 

### How long it took me to finish this?

Far too long. I needed to refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS and I was having considerable trouble with GitHub Pages.
